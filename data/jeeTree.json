Measles immunization is emphasized because it is widely recognized as a proxy indicator for overall immunization against VPDs. Countries will also identify and target immunization to populations at risk of other epidemic-prone VPDs of national importance (e.g., cholera, Japanese encephalitis, meningococcal disease, typhoid, and yellow fever). In the case of some diseases that are transferable from cattle to humans, such as anthrax and rabies, animal immunization should also be taken into account.","notes":"","complete_assessment":false,"complete_costing":false,"indicators":[{"id":"p.7.1","name":"Vaccine coverage (measles) as part of national program","score_descriptions":{"1":"Less than 50% of the country’s 12-month-old population has received at least one dose of measles containing vaccine, as demonstrated by coverage surveys or administrative data; plan is in place to improve coverage, including supplemental immunization activities","2":"50-69% of the country’s 12-month-old population has received at least one dose of measles containing vaccine, as demonstrated by coverage surveys or administrative data; plan is in place to reach 90% within the next five years to include supplemental immunization activities","3":"70-89% of the country’s 12-month-old population has received at least one dose of measles containing vaccine, as demonstrated by coverage surveys or administrative data; plan is in place to reach 90% within the next three years","4":"90% of the country’s 12-month-old population has received at least one dose of measles containing vaccine, as demonstrated by coverage surveys or administrative data. 80% of all sub-national (districts/provinces) units covered","5":"95% of the country’s 12-month-old population has received at least one dose of measles containing vaccine, as demonstrated by coverage surveys or administrative data; or 90% of the country’s 12-month-old population has received at least one dose of measles containing vaccine and the trajectory of progress, plans and capacities are in place to achieve 95% coverage by 2020.
