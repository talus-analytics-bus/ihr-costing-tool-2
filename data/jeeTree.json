        "desired_impact": "Decisive and comprehensive action to enhance infection prevention and control activities to prevent the emergence and spread of AMR, especially among drug-resistant bacteria. Nations will strengthen surveillance and laboratory capacity; ensure uninterrupted access to essential antibiotics of assured quality; regulate and promote the rational use of antibiotics in human medicine and in animal husbandry and other fields as appropriate; and support existing initiatives to foster innovations in science and technology for the development of new antimicrobial agents.",
        "notes": "Priority AMR pathogens may include some, all, or more than the seven selected pathogens listed by the World Health Organization (E. coli, K. pneumonia, S. aureus, S. pneumoniae, Salmonella spp., Shigella spp, N. gonorrheae). Other priority pathogens may be added by national authorities based on country needs including Mycobacterium tuberculosis. The number of designated laboratories for AMR detection/reporting, sentinel sites for surveillance of infections caused by AMR pathogens, facilities for IPC programs, and centres for antimicrobial stewardship will be decided by national authorities. Detection of AMR should occur by recommended standards such as CLSI or EUCAST. Each activity should occur in both veterinary and human sectors. The scope of activities in these two sectors should be decided by national authorities. Healthcare associated infection prevention and control programs might include training, audit and feedback components for personnel in addition to environmental controls such as disinfection and waste management. Antimicrobial stewardship might include uninterrupted access to high-quality medicines to treat bacterial infections, measurements of antibiotic use, regular updates to local antibiograms to inform empiric treatment of infections, and audit-feedback to prescribers of antibiotics to encourage appropriate use.",

This information can be rumours and other ad-hoc reports transmitted through formal channels (i.e. established routine reporting systems) and informal channels (i.e. media, health workers and nongovernmental organizations reports) and can supplement traditional syndromic surveillance.",

FETP Basic Level Training: For local health staff, it consists of limited classroom hours interspersed throughout 3–5 month on the job field assignments to build capacity in conducting timely outbreak detection, public health response, and public health surveillance. FETP Intermediate Level Training: For intermediate levels (district/regions) epidemiologists, it consists of limited classroom hours interspersed throughout 6- 9 month on the job mentored field assignments to build capacity in conducting outbreak investigations, planned epidemiologic studies, and public health surveillance analyses and evaluations. FETP Advanced Level Training: with a national focus for advanced epidemiologists, it consists of limited classroom hours interspersed throughout 24-month mentored field assignments to build capacity in outbreak investigations, planned epidemiologic studies, public health surveillance analyses and evaluations, scientific communication and evidence-based decision making for development of effective public health programming. Workforce development is a crosscutting element, and many other aspects of IHR implementation will depend on strong public health workforce. ",

The framework builds on the existing IHR capacity assessment content, and draws on an evidence-based “logic model” for evaluating emergency risk communication outcomes developed jointly by WHO and Harvard School of Public Health in 2014. Domain 5 (Dynamic listening and rumour management) should be assessed independently as well as in relation to domains 2 (Internal and partner communication and coordination), 3 (Public communication) and 4 (Communication engagement with affected communities).",
