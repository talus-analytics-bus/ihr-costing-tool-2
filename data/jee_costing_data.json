As Measured by: (1)Number of comprehensive plans to combat antimicrobial resistance agreed and implemented at a national level, and yearly reporting against progress towards implementation at the international level. (2)Number of countries actively participating in a twinning framework, with countries agreeing to assist other countries in developing and implementing comprehensive activities to combat antimicrobial resistance, including use of support provided by international bodies to improve the monitoring of antimicrobial usage and resistance in humans and animals.","as_measured_by":"","desired_impact":"Decisive and comprehensive action to enhance infection prevention and control activities to prevent the emergence and spread of AMR, especially among drug-resistant bacteria. Nations will strengthen surveillance and laboratory capacity; ensure uninterrupted access to essential antibiotics of assured quality; regulate and promote the rational use of antibiotics in human medicine and in animal husbandry and other fields as appropriate; and support existing initiatives to foster innovations in science and technology for the development of new antimicrobial agents.","notes":"Priority AMR pathogens may include some, all, or more than the seven selected pathogens listed by the World Health Organization (E. coli, K. pneumonia, S. aureus, S. pneumoniae, Salmonella spp., Shigella spp, N. gonorrheae). Other priority pathogens may be added by national authorities based on country needs including Mycobacterium tuberculosis. The number of designated laboratories for AMR detection/reporting, sentinel sites for surveillance of infections caused by AMR pathogens, facilities for IPC programs, and centres for antimicrobial stewardship will be decided by national authorities. Detection of AMR should occur by recommended standards such as CLSI or EUCAST. Each activity should occur in both veterinary and human sectors. The scope of activities in these two sectors should be decided by national authorities. Healthcare associated infection prevention and control programs might include training, audit and feedback components for personnel in addition to environmental controls such as disinfection and waste management. Antimicrobial stewardship might include uninterrupted access to high-quality medicines to treat bacterial infections, measurements of antibiotic use, regular updates to local antibiograms to inform empiric treatment of infections, and audit-feedback to prescribers of antibiotics to encourage appropriate use.","complete_assessment":false,"complete_costing":false,"indicators":[{"id":"p.3.1","name":"Antimicrobial resistance (AMR) detection","score_descriptions":{"1":"No national plan for detection and reporting of priority AMR pathogens has been approved","2":"National plan for detection and reporting of priority AMR pathogens has been approved","3":"Designated laboratories are conducting detection and reporting of some priority AMR pathogens","4":"Designated laboratories have conducted detection and reporting of all priority AMR pathogens for at least one year","5":"Designated laboratories have conducted detection and reporting of all priority AMR pathogens for five years with a system for continuous improvement"},"user_current_score":null,"user_target_score":null,"covered_by_indicators":[],"actions":[{"id":"p.3.1.1","name":"Develop and implement national action plan for detection and reporting of priority AMR pathogens","type":"action","inputs":[{"id":"p.3.1.1.1","name":"Hold stakeholder workshops to develop action plan","type":"input","line_items":[{"name":"Workshop expenditures","description":"Workshops for stakeholders to develop a national action plan for detection and reporting of priority AMR pathogens","line_item_type":"start-up","category_tag":"Tools and processes","function_tag":"Planning including assessment, design, planning, policy, legislation","base_cost":"gbc.13","base_cost_modified":false,"country_multiplier":"central_area_count","staff_multiplier":null,"staff_multiplier_modified":false,"custom_multiplier_1":"1 day","custom_multiplier_2":"1 workshop","references":"Approach recommended by Global AMR Action Plan.
