As Measured by: (1)Number of comprehensive plans to combat antimicrobial resistance agreed and implemented at a national level, and yearly reporting against progress towards implementation at the international level. (2)Number of countries actively participating in a twinning framework, with countries agreeing to assist other countries in developing and implementing comprehensive activities to combat antimicrobial resistance, including use of support provided by international bodies to improve the monitoring of antimicrobial usage and resistance in humans and animals.",

The number of designated laboratories for AMR detection/reporting, sentinel sites for surveillance of infections caused by AMR pathogens, facilities for IPC programs, and centres for antimicrobial stewardship will be decided by national authorities. Detection of AMR should occur by recommended standards such as CLSI or EUCAST. Each activity should occur in both veterinary and human sectors. The scope of activities in these two sectors should be decided by national authorities. Healthcare associated infection prevention and control programs might include training, audit and feedback components for personnel in addition to environmental controls such as disinfection and waste management. Antimicrobial stewardship might include uninterrupted access to high-quality medicines to treat bacterial infections, measurements of antibiotic use, regular updates to local antibiograms to inform empiric treatment of infections, and audit-feedback to prescribers of antibiotics to encourage appropriate use.",

This information can be rumours and other ad-hoc reports transmitted through formal channels (i.e. established routine reporting systems) and informal channels (i.e. media, health workers and nongovernmental organizations reports) and can supplement traditional syndromic surveillance.",

FETP Intermediate Level Training: For intermediate levels (district/regions) epidemiologists, it consists of limited classroom hours interspersed throughout 6- 9 month on the job mentored field assignments to build capacity in conducting outbreak investigations, planned epidemiologic studies, and public health surveillance analyses and evaluations. FETP Advanced Level Training: with a national focus for advanced epidemiologists, it consists of limited classroom hours interspersed throughout 24-month mentored field assignments to build capacity in outbreak investigations, planned epidemiologic studies, public health surveillance analyses and evaluations, scientific communication and evidence-based decision making for development of effective public health programming.

Domain 5 (Dynamic listening and rumour management) should be assessed independently as well as in relation to domains 2 (Internal and partner communication and coordination), 3 (Public communication) and 4 (Communication engagement with affected communities).",
